ImageSharing Social Media on Stack VM

Created a image sharing social media website for the CCBD Club in PES University as a mini-project. Users can sign up and like and comment on pictures and even upload their own pictures. Deployed the website on a Virtual Machine using Openstack on TryStack platform. Used a MongoDB system, with my own PHP to MongoDB connector.
